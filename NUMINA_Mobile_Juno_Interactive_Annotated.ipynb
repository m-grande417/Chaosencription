    "- Fuses symbolic concepts (like fire + water)\n",
    "- Generates emergent meaning (symbolic name)\n",
    "- Remembers past fusions\n",
    "- Can reverse-deconstruct meaning\n",

    "3. 🔁 Tap **Fuse Concepts**\n",
    "4. 🧠 NUMINA will:\n",
    "   - Output a **new symbolic name**\n",
    "   - Try to **reverse deconstruct** meaning\n",
