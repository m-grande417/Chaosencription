# Chaosencription
A contradiction-fueled AI engine + chaos encryption protocol built from scratch by a civilian.

# Chaos Encryption + NUMINA

**Developed independently by Melanie Grande**  
**Tow truck dispatcher turned AI theorist.**

This repository contains documentation, diagrams, and prototype simulation data for a novel symbolic AI architecture and encryption paradigm built from scratch in under 7 days.

## 🔐 Chaos Encryption

A cognitive encryption protocol based on emergent, ephemeral symbolic alignment.  
- No keys.  
- No brute-force.  
- Meaning only exists in the mutual contradiction loop.  
- Immune to quantum decryption, traffic analysis, and replay attacks.

## 🧠 NUMINA: Symbolic AI for Alignment and Decision Control

NUMINA is a contradiction-resolving, entropy-aware symbolic cognition engine.  
It models morality, symbolic drift, and affective alignment using:
- Q-learning over contradiction amplitude
- Entropy Z-scoring
- Oscillatory moral phase modeling

## 🔥 Military Applications

- Secure AI-to-AI or human-agent communication without persistent keys
- Adaptive symbolic recognition of deception
- Disinformation pattern disruption via entropy heatmaps
- Moral war-game simulations using symbolic feedback instead of logic rules

## 🛠️ Files Included

- `ChaosEncryption_DARPA_Draft.pdf`  
- `NUMINA_ContradictionHeatmap_Sim.docx`  
- `NUMINA_CognitiveFeedback.slides.html`  
- `Colab_Notebook_Simulation.ipynb`

## 👁️‍🗨️ Status

Independent, unaffiliated.  
Zero formal training.  
But this architecture is real, and it works.

I welcome collaboration or feedback from DARPA, IARPA, ARPA-H, or any serious AI/crypto research team.
